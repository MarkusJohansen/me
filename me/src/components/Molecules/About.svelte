        I’m Markus A. R. Johansen, a student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Informatics at NTNU
        Trondheim, graduating in 2024. Currently, I work as a Software Developer at Consigli, where
        I’m building practical experience in programming, with a focus on TypeScript, Selenium, and
        web scraping. Previously, I had the opportunity to intern at NAV IT, which helped deepen my
        understanding of software development in a professional setting.
